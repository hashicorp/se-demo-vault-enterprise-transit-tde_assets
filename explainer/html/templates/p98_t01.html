    <tr>
        <td><strong>Security Model</strong>:
            With a weak security standard, every database server manages its own
            Data Encryption Key and Key Encryption Key.
        </td>
        <td>The attack surface for database servers inadvertently offers an additional
            exploit vector because exfiltrated data can be unencrypted.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><strong>Inefficient Workflow</strong>:
            Database servers follow manual processes to manage
            the lifecycle of Data Encryption Keys and Key Encryption Keys.
        </td>
        <td>Inconsistent practices to rotate encryption keys, re-encrypt data
            at rest, and validation of data integrity.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><strong>Inadequate Governance</strong>:
            There is no centralized audit trail to provide visibility to
            ensure key management lifecycle is compliant and reported.
        </td>
        <td>Teams do not follow authentication and authorization processes,
            leading to a weaker defensive posture.
        </td>
