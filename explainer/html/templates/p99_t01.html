        <td><strong>Security Model</strong>:
            Adopt a zero-trust security posture and remove single-points-of-failure
            in the protection chain for DEK and KEK.

    <tr>
        <td><strong>Centralized Workflow</strong>:
            Establish and enforce strong guidelines to rotate encryption keys,
            re-encrypt data at rest, and validate data integrity with automation.
        </td>
        <td> Database servers adhere to a centralized, automated workflow to manage the

    <tr>
        <td><strong>Strong Governance</strong>:
            Enforce a centralized audit trail to provide visibility to
