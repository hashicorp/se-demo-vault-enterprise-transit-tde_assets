    <tr>
        <td><strong>Security Model</strong>:
            Adopt a zero-trust security posture and remove single-points-of-failure
            in the protection chain for DEK and KEK.
        </td>

            expose their unencrypted Data Encryption Key and Key Encryption Key.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><strong>Centralized Workflow</strong>:
            Establish and enforce strong guidelines to rotate encryption keys,
            re-encrypt data at rest, and validate data integrity with automation.
        </td>
        <td> Database servers adhere to a centralized, automated workflow to manage the
            lifecycle of Data Encryption Keys and Key Encryption Keys.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><strong>Strong Governance</strong>:
            Enforce a centralized audit trail to provide visibility to
            ensure key management lifecycle is complainant and reported.
        </td>
        <td>Teams establish authentication and authorization processes for the
            lifecycle of encryption keys, enforced by policies that support audit
            and control standards.
